* Fixes
** TODO Somehow wrap the server in a class
Currently, client code, like the integ tests, address the server via the module.
It would make more sense to me if the server was an instantiated class,
on which we can inject data at instantiation.

Either I am going to learn that this is actually pretty OK for Python code, or I need to figure out a way to get a Flask server running inside a class.

(So far, I have not been able to get the routing annotations to work if the routing methods are in a class)
** TODO Make test filesystem interaction OS agnostic
Tests currently rely on /tmp/ folder, making it unix specific
** TODO Use proper path libraries, not string manipulation
